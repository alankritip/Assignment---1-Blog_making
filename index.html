        <h3>From Hip-Hop Grooves to Classical Grace:</h3>
        <p>I have always been drawn to the high-energy moves of Hip-Hop and the vibrant expressions of Bollywood dance. The footwork, the attitude, the swag—it just felt like the perfect way to express myself. But when I first attempted classical dance, something unexpected happened—I felt an effortless connection. The grace, the storytelling, the rhythm—it suited my personality in ways I never imagined!</p>
        <img src="assets/dance_img.jpg" height="450px" width="500px" alt="dance_img">
        <p>Dance has always evolved by blending cultures and styles. Some of the most iconic dance movements today stem from a fusion of classical and modern influences. Bollywood itself is a melting pot—drawing from Indian classical forms like Bharatanatyam and Kathak, mixed with global styles like Jazz, Hip-Hop, and Salsa.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exploring classical dance as a Hip-Hop and Bollywood enthusiast felt foreign yet intriguing. The precise mudras and tatkar were challenging, but I found a rhythm that resonated with me, deepening my appreciation for storytelling through abhinaya.</li>
            <li>I draw inspiration from Shakti Mohan's fusion of Kathak and Hip-Hop, Michael Jackson's impact on Bollywood, Hrithik Roshan's freestyle in Bang Bang, and Remo D'Souza's choreography in ABCD, showcasing the beauty of blending dance styles.</li>
            <li>Exploring different dance forms taught me that Hip-Hop offers freedom, while Classical dance instills discipline and grace. Fusion enhances tradition rather than replacing it, and the best dancers continuously experiment and evolve.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dance has evolved by blending cultural styles, with Bollywood itself being a mix of classical, folk, hip-hop, jazz, and contemporary dance. Madhuri Dixit's Kathak-infused grace, Prabhudeva's fusion of Western street dance with Indian elements, and movies like ABCD and Street Dancer 3D highlight the beauty of merging dance forms.</p>

        <h3>Shakespeare's Timeless Tales:</h3>
        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline solid 1px black;" >The Merchant of Venice </h4>
        <p>William Shakespeare, the master of storytelling, has shaped literature with his timeless plays. Whether it's love, power, justice, or magic, his works continue to resonate across generations. Among his many masterpieces, The Merchant of Venice and The Tempest stand out for their rich themes, unforgettable characters, and deep moral questions.</p>
        <img src="assets/book1merchant.jpg" height="500px" width="500px" alt="book1_img">
        <ul>
            <li> A complex tale of justice vs. mercy, featuring the famous courtroom scene where Portia delivers “The quality of mercy is not strained.”</li>
            <li>Shylock, the Jewish moneylender, is both a villain and a victim, making us question morality and bias.</li>
            <li>The contrast between Venetian commerce and romantic ideals creates a layered story about human nature.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline solid 1px black;">The Tempest</h4>
        <img src="assets/The Tempest.webp" height="500" width="500" alt="book2_img">
        <ul>
            <li>A story of betrayal, forgiveness, and magic, set on an enchanted island where Prospero controls fate.</li>
            <li>Themes of colonialism are subtly woven into Prospero's rule over Caliban—was he a benevolent ruler or an oppressor?</li>
            <li>Ariel, the spirit, represents freedom and servitude, making us rethink what it means to be truly free.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Merchant of Venice feels realistic, dealing with justice, human greed, and social discrimination.The Tempest is fantastical, exploring magic, revenge, and redemption.Both plays emphasize power and control, but one through law (Merchant) and the other through supernatural means (Tempest).</p>

        <h3>The Chocolate Cake Experiment!</h3>
        <p>Baking has always fascinated me, but I had never attempted a full-fledged dessert from scratch—until I decided to make a chocolate cake for a birthday celebration. From mixing the batter to decorating it with sparkle balls and extra chocolates, it was a journey full of learning (and delicious mistakes!).</p>
        <img src="assets/cake_img.jpg" height="450px" width="500px" alt="cake_img">
        <p>Here is the Step-by-Step Journey:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mixing the Batter: I carefully measured flour, cocoa powder, sugar, eggs, and butter, making sure to get the right consistency.</li>
            <li> Baking: The oven was set, and I watched eagerly as the cake rose perfectly (or so I thought!).</li>
            <li>Decorating: After letting it cool, I covered it in rich chocolate frosting, added chocolate shavings, sparkle balls, and extra treats to make it look as good as it tasted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are some challenges which I faced during this process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting the cake texture just right was tricky—at first, it was too dry, but adding a little extra milk saved it!</li>
            <li>Spreading the frosting evenly without making a mess took patience.</li>
            <li>Sticking all the decorations properly was harder than I expected!</li>
        </ul>

            <source src="assets/cake_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        <p> I have also Learned a Lesson that Baking is not just about the recipe but also technique and timing. The cake turned out delicious, and seeing everyone enjoy it made the effort worth it!</p>
